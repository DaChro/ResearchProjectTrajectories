* Arguments:
    + `trs`: A `Tracks`object.

* Value: 
    + `list` containing the `data.frame` objects representing the slot `data` and `time` (binded together as `data.frame`) of the `Track` objects of the specified `Tracks` object as elements.

## locationsTracks

Function in order to identify distinct locations in a `Tracks` object and the order of the visit of these locations and in order to compute various variables concerning the visit of a specific location (mean latitude, mean longitude, mean elevation, residence time, arrival time, departure time, speed). The identification of locations is based on the identification of clusters of fixes by identifying intersecting buffers around each fix. Campsites are distinguished from other locations by a specified minimal residence time.

* Arguments:
    + `trs`: A `Tracks`object.
    + `radius`: The radius of the buffers computed around each value [m] which are used for clustering values to locations. Default is `radius = 200` [m].

* Value: 
    + A `Tracks` object containing the following columns within the data slot:
        1. `location`: An integer value discriminating different locations.
        2. `res.time`: The residence time at a specific location [s].
        3. `campsite`: A logical value indicating whether a specific visit of a location is considered as campsite or not (based on `t.min`).
        4. `arrival.time`: A character representing the arrival time for a specific visit of a location. The format is `"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"`.
        5. `departure.time`: A character representing the departure time for a specific visit of a location. The format is `"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"`.
        6. `lat`: A numeric value representing the centroids for the latitude of fixes corresponding to a specific visit of a location [°].
        7. `lon`: A numeric value representing the centroids for the longitude of fixes corresponding to a specific visit of a location [°].
        8. `alt`: A numeric value representing the mean elevation value of fixes corresponding to a specific visit of a location [m].
        9. `speed`: A numeric value indicating the mean speed at the time fixes were taken for fixes corresponding to a specific visit of a location [m s<sup>-1</sup>].

## summaryIndicators1

Function in order to compute various summary indicators for the movement of herders, solely based on a `Tracks` object. The function uses the output of the function `locationsTracks` (i.e. is based on a `Tracks` object). Therefore, movement summary indicators are solely based on identified locations, i.e. distances represent the linear distances between the locations.  

* Arguments:
    + `trsloc`: A `Tracks`object as returned by `locationsTracks`.
    + `time`: A `POSIXct` vector of length two specifying a target time interval for which to compute the summary indicators. `time[1]` represents the start time point, `time[2]` represents the start time point. All locations with `loctrs$arrival.time >= time[1]` and `loctrs$departure.time <= time[2]` will be considered. If `time = NULL`, no temporal subsetting of the data is performed. Default is `time = NULL`.
    + `only.campsites`: A logical value indicating if during the computation of the summary indicators only campsites (`only.campsites = T`) or all identified locations (`only.campsites = F`) should be considered. Default is `only.campsites = T`.

* Value: 
    + `data.frame` containing the following columns:
        1. 
     
* Issues:
    + The function will be extended for the use with outputs from `extractClusters`.


```{r summaryIndicators1, eval = T, message = F, warning = F}
summaryIndicators1 <- function(){}
```

## FixesForDays

Function in order to identify the days within a specified time period, for which data points are available within a specified `Tracks` object.

* Arguments:
    + `trs`: A `Tracks`object.
    + `time`: A `POSIXct` vector with the first element representing the start value of the respective time interval and the second element representing the end value of the respective time interval. The format is `"%Y-%m-%d"`.

* Value: 
    + An integer `vector` of the length equal the number of days within the time interval specified by `time` with `1` representing that at least one data point is available for a day and `0` that this is not the case.

```{r FixesForDays, eval = T, message = F, warning = F}
FixesForDays <- function(trs,
                        time
){
  
  # get Tracks data

  # get time interval
  time <- strftime(seq(from = time[1], to = time[2], by = 24*60*60), format = "%Y-%m-%d")
  
  print(days)
  
  # create vector to store results in
  fix.pres <- rep(0, days)
  
  # extract time information from trs
  trs.time <- unique(strftime(trs.df$time, format = "%Y-%m-%d"))
  
  # identify present data

  return(fix.pres)
   
}
```

## FixesForDaysTrColl

* Arguments:
    + `trscoll`: A `TracksCollection`object.
    + `time`: A `POSIXct` vector with the first element representing the start value of the respective time interval and the second element representing the end value of the respective time interval. The format is `"%Y-%m-%d"`.
    + `cores`: number of cores to use in parallel computing. Default is `cores = 1`.

* Value: 
    + An integer `vector` of the length equal the number of days within the time interval specified by `time` with `1` representing that at least one data point is available for a day and `0` that this is not the case.

* Issues:
    + Does not function yet.
