* Arguments:
    + `trs`: A `Tracks`object.

* Value: 
    + `list` containing the `data.frame` objects representing the slot `data` and `time` (binded together as `data.frame`) of the `Track` objects of the specified `Tracks` object as elements.

```

## locationsTracks

Function in order to identify distinct locations in a `Tracks` object and the order of the visit of these locations and in order to compute various variables concerning the visit of a specific location (mean latitude, mean longitude, mean elevation, residence time, arrival time, departure time, speed). The identification of locations is based on the identification of clusters of fixes by identifying intersecting buffers around each fix. Campsites are distinguished from other locations by a specified minimal residence time.

* Arguments:
    + `trs`: A `Tracks`object.
    + `radius`: The radius of the buffers computed around each value [m] which are used for clustering values to locations. Default is `radius = 200` [m].
    + `t.min`: The minimum residence time at a specific location [s] which is used to classify locations as campsites (if the residence time is larger than `t.min`) in contrast to other locations. The default is `t.min = 345600`, i.e. 4 days.

* Value: 
    + A `Tracks` object containing the following columns within the data slot:
        1. `location`: An integer value discriminating different locations.
        2. `res.time`: The residence time at a specific location [s].
        3. `campsite`: A logical value indicating whether a specific visit of a location is considered as campsite or not (based on `t.min`).
        4. `arrival.time`: A character representing the arrival time for a specific visit of a location. The format is `"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"`.
        5. `departure.time`: A character representing the departure time for a specific visit of a location. The format is `"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"`.
        6. `lat`: A numeric value representing the centroids for the latitude of fixes corresponding to a specific visit of a location [°].
        7. `lon`: A numeric value representing the centroids for the longitude of fixes corresponding to a specific visit of a location [°].
        8. `alt`: A numeric value representing the mean elevation value of fixes corresponding to a specific visit of a location [m].
        9. `speed`: A numeric value indicating the mean speed at the time fixes were taken for fixes corresponding to a specific visit of a location [m s<sup>-1</sup>].

## summaryIndicators1

Function in order to compute various summary indicators for the movement of herders, solely based on a `Tracks` object. The function uses the output of the function `locationsTracks` (i.e. is based on a `Tracks` object). Therefore, movement summary indicators are solely based on identified locations, i.e. distances represent the linear distances between the locations.  

* Arguments:
    + `trsloc`: A `Tracks`object (as returned by `locationsTracks`).
    + `time`: A `POSIXct` vector of length two specifying a target time interval for which to compute the summary indicators. `time[1]` represents the start time point, `time[2]` represents the end time point. All locations with `trsloc$departure.time >= time[1]` and `trsloc$arrival.time <= time[2]` will be considered. If `time = NULL`, no temporal subsetting of the data is performed. Default is `time = NULL`.
    + `drought.r`: A `RasterStack` or `Rasterbrick` object with information on drought conditions (more details have to be provided if the function to evaluate drought conditions is finished and tested). If not provided (i.e. `drought.r = NULL`), no summary indicators related to drought conditions will be computed. Default is `drought.r = NULL`.
    + `dzud.r`: A `RasterStack` or `Rasterbrick` object with information on dzud conditions (more details have to be provided if the function to evaluate drought conditions is finished and tested). If not provided (i.e. `dzud.r = NULL`), no summary indicators related to drought conditions will be computed. Default is `dzud.r = NULL`.
    + `landcover`: A `SpatialPointsDataFrame` object with information on the landcover type. If not provided (i.e. `landcover = NULL`), no summary indicators related to drought conditions will be computed. Default is `landcover = NULL`.
    + `ndvi.r`: A `RasterStack` or `Rasterbrick` object with information on dzud conditions (more details have to be provided if the function to evaluate drought conditions is finished and tested). If not provided (i.e. `ndvi.r = NULL`), no summary indicators related to drought conditions will be computed. Default is `ndvi.r = NULL`.
    + `dgm.r`: A `RasterStack` or `Rasterbrick` object with information on the landscape elevation (digital ground model). If not provided (i.e. `dgm.r = NULL`), elevation differences will be computed as difference between the altitude of two adjacent campsite locations. Default is `dgm.r = NULL`. (Currently not supported because it is unclear if distances based on linear distances between adjacent fixes are more precise than linear distances between campsites).

* Value: 
    + `list` containing the following elements:
        1. `distance.tot`: A numeric value indicating the total linear distance [m] between adjacent camspites. 
        2. `alt.tot`: A numeric value indicating the the total altitudinal difference [m] between adjacent campsites, either computed from the campsite locations (if `dgm.r = NULL`) or from the values of a DGM along a straight line between the campsites (if `dgm.r != NULL`).
        3. `campsites.time.tot`: A numeric value indicating the total time spend within campsites [s], i.e. the sum of the intervals between arrival at and departure from a campsite for all campsites. If `time != NULL`, the residence time at the first and last campsite are conmputed from the difference between `time[1]` and the departure time for the first campsite and the difference between `time[2]` and the arrival time for the last campsite, respectively.
        4. `nocampsites.time.tot`: A numeric value indicating the total time spend between campsites [s] as: `as.numeric(difftime(time[2], time[1], units = "secs")) - campsites.time.tot`.
        5. `no.campsites.tot`: A numeric value indicating the total number of unique campsites (i.e. neglecting repeated visits or counting locations respectively). 
        6. `no.repeated.visits.tot`: A numeric value indicating the total number of repeated visits for all unique campsites.
        7. `dist.max.tot`: A numeric value indicating the maximum distance [m] between two adjacent campsites.
     
* Issues:
    + The function will be extended for the use with outputs from `extractClusters`.

## summaryIndicators2

Function in order to compute various summary indicators for the movement of herders, based on a `Tracks` object and different `RasterBrick` or `RasterStack` objects from which values are extracted. The function uses the output of the function `locationsTracks` (i.e. is based on a `Tracks` object). Therefore, movement summary indicators are solely based on identified locations, i.e. distances represent the linear distances between the locations.  

* Arguments:
    + `trsloc`: A `Tracks`object (as returned by `locationsTracks`).
    + `time`: A `POSIXct` vector of length two specifying a target time interval for which to compute the summary indicators. `time[1]` represents the start time point, `time[2]` represents the end time point. All locations with `trsloc$departure.time >= time[1]` and `trsloc$arrival.time <= time[2]` will be considered. If `time = NULL`, no temporal subsetting of the data is performed. Default is `time = NULL`.
    + `drought.r`: A `RasterStack` or `Rasterbrick` object with information on drought conditions (more details have to be provided if the function to evaluate drought conditions is finished and tested). If not provided (i.e. `drought.r = NULL`), no summary indicators related to drought conditions will be computed. Default is `drought.r = NULL`.
    + `dzud.r`: A `RasterStack` or `Rasterbrick` object with information on dzud conditions (more details have to be provided if the function to evaluate drought conditions is finished and tested). If not provided (i.e. `dzud.r = NULL`), no summary indicators related to drought conditions will be computed. Default is `dzud.r = NULL`.
    + `landcover`: A `SpatialPointsDataFrame` object with information on the landcover type. If not provided (i.e. `landcover = NULL`), no summary indicators related to drought conditions will be computed. Default is `landcover = NULL`.
    + `ndvi.r`: A `RasterStack` or `Rasterbrick` object with information on dzud conditions (more details have to be provided if the function to evaluate drought conditions is finished and tested). If not provided (i.e. `ndvi.r = NULL`), no summary indicators related to drought conditions will be computed. Default is `ndvi.r = NULL`.
    + `dgm.r`: A `RasterStack` or `Rasterbrick` object with information on the landscape elevation (digital ground model). If not provided (i.e. `dgm.r = NULL`), elevation differences will be computed as difference between the altitude of two adjacent campsite locations. Default is `dgm.r = NULL`. (Currently not supported because it is unclear if distances based on linear distances between adjacent fixes are more precise than linear distances between campsites).

* Value: 
    + `list` containing the following elements:
        1. `distance.tot`: A numeric value indicating the total linear distance [m] between adjacent camspites. 
       
     
* Issues:
    + The function will be extended for the use with outputs from `extractClusters`.

TrackToSpatialPointsDataFrame <- function(trs
){
  
  # get Tracks data
  trs.df <- trs@data
  
  # convert track to SpatialPointsDataFrame and transform to UTM

```

## extractClustersBuffer

Function in order to cluster the points of a `SpatialPoints` object based on their intersection with buffers constructed around the points. Internal function used by `locationsTracks2`.

* Arguments:
    + `trsSP`: A `SpatialPointsDataFrame`object representing a `Track` object, i.e. the result of the function `TrackToSpatialPointsDataFrame`.
    + `radius`: The radius of the buffers computed around each value [m] which are used for clustering values to locations. Default is `radius = 200` [m].

* Value: 
    + An `integer` vector with the same length as the number of points in `trsSP` indicating to which cluster each point is assigned. Cluster indices are not ordered, however points of `trsSP` representing gaps (as indicated by `trsSP@data$gap`) obtain the cluster index `0`.

```{r extractClustersBuffer, eval = T, message = F, warning = F}
extractClustersBuffer <- function(trsSP, radius = 200
){
  
   # indices with points that have not been assigned to a cluster yet
  leftover <- c(1:length(trsSP))

    # subset leftover
    if(length(which(is.na(a.tot))) != 0){
      leftover <- leftover.old[which(is.na(a.tot))]
    }else{
      leftover = NULL
      
      a.tot <- over(trsSP, disaggregate(buffer.trs.tot))
    }
    
  }
  
  # set location of gaps to 0
  a.tot[which(trsSP@data$gap == T)] <- 0
  
  # return result
  return(a.tot)
  
}
```

## locationsTracks2

Function in order to identify distinct locations in a `Tracks` object and the order of the visit of these locations and in order to compute various variables concerning the visit of a specific location (mean latitude, mean longitude, mean elevation, residence time, arrival time, departure time, speed, number of visits at location i). The identification of locations is based on the identification of clusters of fixes by identifying intersecting buffers around each fix. Campsites are distinguished from other locations by a specified minimal residence time. In contrast to the function above, this function handles `Track` objects that have an extra boolean column `gap` in the slot `data` indicating missing data values along a regular spaced time vector.

* Arguments:
    + `trs`: A `Track`object.
    + `radius`: The radius of the buffers computed around each value [m] which are used for clustering values to locations. Default is `radius = 200` [m].
    + `t.min`: The minimum residence time at a specific location [s] which is used to classify locations as campsites (if the residence time is larger than `t.min`) in contrast to other locations. The default is `t.min = 345600`, i.e. 4 days.
    + `return_summary`: A logical value indicating if data points of `trs` should be collapsed by visits and locations (i.e. one data point per visit and location) (`return_summary = T`) or if all data points of `trs` should just be assigned to a location, a visit and classified as campsite or not (`return_summary = F`). Default is `return_summary = T`.
    + `remove_gaps`: A logical value indicating if all visits representing gaps should be removed in the output. Its effect depends on the value of `merge_inter_gaps`. If `return_summary = F`, `remove_gaps` will be ignored. Default is `remove_gaps = T`. 
    + `merge_inter_gaps`: A logical value indicating if adjacent visits at the same location should be merged as one visit if there is a gap between them (`merge_inter_gaps = T`) or not (`merge_inter_gaps = F`). If `return_summary = F` or `remove_gaps = F`, `merge_inter_gaps` will be ignored. Default is `merge_inter_gaps = T`
    + `merge_campsites`: A logical value indicating if visits not representing campsites should be dropped, i.e. only visits representing campsites should be considered. If `merge_campsites = T`, visits which are no campsites are deleted and visits at the same location which are campsites and now are adjacent, are merged. Default is `merge_campsites = T`. `merge_campsites` will be ignored if `return_summary = F` and `merge_inter_gaps = F` and `remove_gaps = F`

* Value: 
    + A `Tracks` object containing the following columns within the data slot:
        1. `location`: An integer value discriminating different locations.
        2. `visits`: An integer vector indicating the number of visit at a specific location (indicated by `location`) the data point is assigned to (i.e. counter for the visits at a location).
        2. `res.time`: The residence time at a specific location [s], only if `return_summary = T`.
        3. `campsite`: A logical value indicating whether a specific visit of a location is considered as campsite or not (based on `t.min`).
        4. `arrival.time`: A character representing the arrival time for a specific visit of a location. The format is `"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"`, only if `return_summary = T`..
        5. `departure.time`: A character representing the departure time for a specific visit of a location. The format is `"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"`, only if `return_summary = T`..
        6. `lat`: A numeric value representing the centroids for the latitude of fixes corresponding to a specific visit of a location [°].
        7. `lon`: A numeric value representing the centroids for the longitude of fixes corresponding to a specific visit of a location [°].
        8. `alt`: A numeric value representing the mean elevation value of fixes corresponding to a specific visit of a location [m].
        9. `speed`: A numeric value indicating the mean speed at the time fixes were taken for fixes corresponding to a specific visit of a location [m s<sup>-1</sup>].
