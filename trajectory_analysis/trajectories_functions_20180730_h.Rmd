Function that checks whether the clusters/campsites have been visited more than the currently known visits (`times_visited`). Updates `times_visited` and determines end (latest point in cell) of current visit. This function is used by function `clusterOrder()`.

* Arguments:
  + `cells`: A `SpatialPolygonsDataFrame` holding the cells determined as clusters/campsites
+ `trs_spdf`: A `SpatialPointsDataFrame` of the household movement (as converted from `Tracks` object)

* Value:
  + `cells`: A `SpatialPolygonsDataFrame` holding the clusters/campsites with updated `times_visited`

## clusterOrder

Function that identifies campsites (clusters of points) of a household (`Tracks` object) and for each cluster/campsite determines the number of visits, the order in which the clusters have been visited, and the start and end times (first and last point) of each visits.

* Arguments:
  + `trs`: A `Tracks`object.
+ `cellsize`: Desired size of the cells in which to count the points when searching clusters/campsites. Passed on to function `extractClusters()`. 
+ `threshold`: Threshold (number of points per cell) defining a "cluster". Passed on to function `extractClusters()`.


* Value: 
  + `clusters`: A `SpatialPolygonsDataFrame` holding the cells determined as clusters including data on the number of visits per cluster, start and end times etc.

```

## locationsTracks

Function in order to identify distinct locations in a `Tracks` object and the order of the visit of these locations and in order to compute various variables concerning the visit of a specific location (mean latitude, mean longitude, mean elevation, residence time, arrival time, departure time, speed). The identification of locations is based on the identification of clusters of fixes by identifying intersecting buffers around each fix. Campsites are distinguished from other locations by a specified minimal residence time.

* Arguments:
  + `trs`: A `Tracks`object.
+ `radius`: The radius of the buffers computed around each value [m] which are used for clustering values to locations. Default is `radius = 200` [m].
+ `t.min`: The minimum residence time at a specific location [s] which is used to classify locations as campsites (if the residence time is larger than `t.min`) in contrast to other locations. The default is `t.min = 345600`, i.e. 4 days.

* Value: 
  + A `Tracks` object containing the following columns within the data slot:
  1. `location`: An integer value discriminating different locations.
2. `res.time`: The residence time at a specific location [s].
3. `campsite`: A logical value indicating whether a specific visit of a location is considered as campsite or not (based on `t.min`).
4. `arrival.time`: A character representing the arrival time for a specific visit of a location. The format is `"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"`.
5. `departure.time`: A character representing the departure time for a specific visit of a location. The format is `"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"`.
6. `lat`: A numeric value representing the centroids for the latitude of fixes corresponding to a specific visit of a location [?].
7. `lon`: A numeric value representing the centroids for the longitude of fixes corresponding to a specific visit of a location [?].
8. `alt`: A numeric value representing the mean elevation value of fixes corresponding to a specific visit of a location [m].
9. `speed`: A numeric value indicating the mean speed at the time fixes were taken for fixes corresponding to a specific visit of a location [m s<sup>-1</sup>].

## summaryIndicators1

Function in order to compute various summary indicators for the movement of herders, solely based on a `Tracks` object. The function uses the output of the function `locationsTracks` (i.e. is based on a `Tracks` object). Therefore, movement summary indicators are solely based on identified locations, i.e. distances represent the linear distances between the locations.  

* Arguments:
    + `trsloc`: A `Tracks`object (as returned by `locationsTracks`).
    + `time`: A `POSIXct` vector of length two specifying a target time interval for which to compute the summary indicators. `time[1]` represents the start time point, `time[2]` represents the end time point. All locations with `trsloc$departure.time >= time[1]` and `trsloc$arrival.time <= time[2]` will be considered. If `time = NULL`, no temporal subsetting of the data is performed. Default is `time = NULL`.
    + `drought.r`: A `RasterStack` or `Rasterbrick` object with information on drought conditions (more details have to be provided if the function to evaluate drought conditions is finished and tested). If not provided (i.e. `drought.r = NULL`), no summary indicators related to drought conditions will be computed. Default is `drought.r = NULL`.
    + `dzud.r`: A `RasterStack` or `Rasterbrick` object with information on dzud conditions (more details have to be provided if the function to evaluate drought conditions is finished and tested). If not provided (i.e. `dzud.r = NULL`), no summary indicators related to drought conditions will be computed. Default is `dzud.r = NULL`.
    + `landcover`: A `SpatialPointsDataFrame` object with information on the landcover type. If not provided (i.e. `landcover = NULL`), no summary indicators related to drought conditions will be computed. Default is `landcover = NULL`.
    + `ndvi.r`: A `RasterStack` or `Rasterbrick` object with information on dzud conditions (more details have to be provided if the function to evaluate drought conditions is finished and tested). If not provided (i.e. `ndvi.r = NULL`), no summary indicators related to drought conditions will be computed. Default is `ndvi.r = NULL`.
    + `dgm.r`: A `RasterStack` or `Rasterbrick` object with information on the landscape elevation (digital ground model). If not provided (i.e. `dgm.r = NULL`), elevation differences will be computed as difference between the altitude of two adjacent campsite locations. Default is `dgm.r = NULL`. (Currently not supported because it is unclear if distances based on linear distances between adjacent fixes are more precise than linear distances between campsites).

* Value: 
    + `list` containing the following elements:
        1. `distance.tot`: A numeric value indicating the total linear distance [m] between adjacent camspites. 
        2. `alt.tot`: A numeric value indicating the the total altitudinal difference [m] between adjacent campsites, either computed from the campsite locations (if `dgm.r = NULL`) or from the values of a DGM along a straight line between the campsites (if `dgm.r != NULL`).
        3. `campsites.time.tot`: A numeric value indicating the total time spend within campsites [s], i.e. the sum of the intervals between arrival at and departure from a campsite for all campsites. If `time != NULL`, the residence time at the first and last campsite are conmputed from the difference between `time[1]` and the departure time for the first campsite and the difference between `time[2]` and the arrival time for the last campsite, respectively.
        4. `nocampsites.time.tot`: A numeric value indicating the total time spend between campsites [s] as: `as.numeric(difftime(time[2], time[1], units = "secs")) - campsites.time.tot`.
        5. `no.campsites.tot`: A numeric value indicating the total number of unique campsites (i.e. neglecting repeated visits or counting locations respectively). 
        6. `no.repeated.visits.tot`: A numeric value indicating the total number of repeated visits for all unique campsites.
        7. `dist.max.tot`: A numeric value indicating the maximum distance [m] between two adjacent campsites.
     
* Issues:
    + The function will be extended for the use with outputs from `extractClusters`.

## summaryIndicators2

Function in order to compute various summary indicators for the movement of herders, based on a `Tracks` object and different `RasterBrick` or `RasterStack` objects from which values are extracted. The function uses the output of the function `locationsTracks` (i.e. is based on a `Tracks` object). Therefore, movement summary indicators are solely based on identified locations, i.e. distances represent the linear distances between the locations.  

* Arguments:
    + `trsloc`: A `Tracks`object (as returned by `locationsTracks`).
    + `time`: A `POSIXct` vector of length two specifying a target time interval for which to compute the summary indicators. `time[1]` represents the start time point, `time[2]` represents the end time point. All locations with `trsloc$departure.time >= time[1]` and `trsloc$arrival.time <= time[2]` will be considered. If `time = NULL`, no temporal subsetting of the data is performed. Default is `time = NULL`.
    + `drought.r`: A `RasterStack` or `Rasterbrick` object with information on drought conditions (more details have to be provided if the function to evaluate drought conditions is finished and tested). If not provided (i.e. `drought.r = NULL`), no summary indicators related to drought conditions will be computed. Default is `drought.r = NULL`.
    + `dzud.r`: A `RasterStack` or `Rasterbrick` object with information on dzud conditions (more details have to be provided if the function to evaluate drought conditions is finished and tested). If not provided (i.e. `dzud.r = NULL`), no summary indicators related to drought conditions will be computed. Default is `dzud.r = NULL`.
    + `landcover`: A `SpatialPointsDataFrame` object with information on the landcover type. If not provided (i.e. `landcover = NULL`), no summary indicators related to drought conditions will be computed. Default is `landcover = NULL`.
    + `ndvi.r`: A `RasterStack` or `Rasterbrick` object with information on dzud conditions (more details have to be provided if the function to evaluate drought conditions is finished and tested). If not provided (i.e. `ndvi.r = NULL`), no summary indicators related to drought conditions will be computed. Default is `ndvi.r = NULL`.
    + `dgm.r`: A `RasterStack` or `Rasterbrick` object with information on the landscape elevation (digital ground model). If not provided (i.e. `dgm.r = NULL`), elevation differences will be computed as difference between the altitude of two adjacent campsite locations. Default is `dgm.r = NULL`. (Currently not supported because it is unclear if distances based on linear distances between adjacent fixes are more precise than linear distances between campsites).

* Value: 
    + `list` containing the following elements:
        1. `distance.tot`: A numeric value indicating the total linear distance [m] between adjacent camspites. 
       
     
* Issues:
    + The function will be extended for the use with outputs from `extractClusters`.

## locationsTracks

Function in order to identify distinct locations in a `Tracks` object and the order of the visit of these locations and in order to compute various variables concerning the visit of a specific location (mean latitude, mean longitude, mean elevation, residence time, arrival time, departure time, speed, number of visits at location i). The identification of locations is based on the identification of clusters of fixes by identifying intersecting buffers around each fix. Campsites are distinguished from other locations by a specified minimal residence time. In contrast to the function above, this function handles `Track` objects that have an extra boolean column `gap` in the slot `data` indicating missing data values along a regular spaced time vector.

* Arguments:
  + `trs`: A `Track`object.
+ `radius`: The radius of the buffers computed around each value [m] which are used for clustering values to locations. Default is `radius = 200` [m].
+ `t.min`: The minimum residence time at a specific location [s] which is used to classify locations as campsites (if the residence time is larger than `t.min`) in contrast to other locations. The default is `t.min = 345600`, i.e. 4 days.
+ `return_summary`: A logical value indicating if data points of `trs` should be collapsed by visits and locations (i.e. one data point per visit and location) (`return_summary = T`) or if all data points of `trs` should just be assigned to a location, a visit and classified as campsite or not (`return_summary = F`). Default is `return_summary = T`.
+ `remove_gaps`: A logical value indicating if all visits representing gaps should be removed in the output. Its effect depends on the value of `merge_inter_gaps`. If `return_summary = F`, `remove_gaps` will be ignored. Default is `remove_gaps = T`. 
+ `merge_inter_gaps`: A logical value indicating if adjacent visits at the same location should be merged as one visit if there is a gap between them (`merge_inter_gaps = T`) or not (`merge_inter_gaps = F`). If `return_summary = F` or `remove_gaps = F`, `merge_inter_gaps` will be ignored. Default is `merge_inter_gaps = T`
+ `merge_campsites`: A logical value indicating if visits not representing campsites should be dropped, i.e. only visits representing campsites should be considered. If `merge_campsites = T`, visits which are no campsites are deleted and visits at the same location which are campsites and now are adjacent, are merged. Default is `merge_campsites = T`. `merge_campsites` will be ignored if `return_summary = F` and `merge_inter_gaps = F` and `remove_gaps = F`

* Value: 
  + A `Tracks` object containing the following columns within the data slot:
  1. `location`: An integer value discriminating different locations.
2. `visits`: An integer vector indicating the number of visit at a specific location (indicated by `location`) the data point is assigned to (i.e. counter for the visits at a location).
2. `res.time`: The residence time at a specific location [s], only if `return_summary = T`.
3. `campsite`: A logical value indicating whether a specific visit of a location is considered as campsite or not (based on `t.min`).
4. `arrival.time`: A character representing the arrival time for a specific visit of a location. The format is `"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"`, only if `return_summary = T`..
5. `departure.time`: A character representing the departure time for a specific visit of a location. The format is `"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"`, only if `return_summary = T`..
6. `lat`: A numeric value representing the centroids for the latitude of fixes corresponding to a specific visit of a location [?].
7. `lon`: A numeric value representing the centroids for the longitude of fixes corresponding to a specific visit of a location [?].
8. `alt`: A numeric value representing the mean elevation value of fixes corresponding to a specific visit of a location [m].
9. `speed`: A numeric value indicating the mean speed at the time fixes were taken for fixes corresponding to a specific visit of a location [m s<sup>-1</sup>].

## redefineIndices

Function in order to redefine a column with index values (integer) according to a column with time information, i.e. new indices will be assigned to each set of rows with the same index in relation to their order in time.

* Arguments:
    + `df`: A `data.frame`object with a column representing indices and a column representing time information as `POSIXct`.
    + `indices`: A character vector giving the name of the column of `df` which contains the index values.
    + `time`: A character vector giving the name of the column of `df` which contains the time values
    + `notchange`: An integer vector specifying which original index values should not be changed. Default is `notchange = NULL`, i.e. all indices will be changed.

* Value: 
    + A `data.frame` object with the redefined index values.

```{r redefineIndices, eval = T, message = F, warning = F}

## locationsTracks3

Function in order to identify distinct locations in a `Tracks` object and the order of the visit of these locations and in order to compute various variables concerning the visit of a specific location (mean latitude, mean longitude, mean elevation, residence time, arrival time, departure time, speed, number of visits at location i). The identification of locations is based on the identification of clusters of fixes by identifying intersecting buffers around each fix. Campsites are distinguished from other locations by a specified minimal residence time. In contrast to `locationsTracks`, this function does not any more handle gaps because the imputation of missing values is assumed to be performed with `fillGapTrack`. Therefore, gaps are not presented as individual visits and data values will not be merged by `locationsTracks3`.

* Arguments:
    + `trs`: A `Track`object.
    + `radius`: The radius of the buffers computed around each value [m] which are used for clustering values to locations. Default is `radius = 200` [m].
    + `t.min`: The minimum residence time at a specific location [s] which is used to classify locations as campsites (if the residence time is larger than `t.min`) in contrast to other locations. The default is `t.min = 345600`, i.e. 4 days.
    + `return_summary`: A logical value indicating if data points of `trs` should be collapsed by visits and locations (i.e. one data point per visit and location) (`return_summary = T`) or if all data points of `trs` should just be assigned to a location, a visit and classified as campsite or not (`return_summary = F`). Default is `return_summary = T`.

* Value: 
    + A `Tracks` object containing the following columns within the data slot:
        1. `location`: An integer value discriminating different locations.
        2. `visits.loc`: An integer vector indicating the number of visit at a specific location (indicated by `location`) the data point is assigned to (i.e. counter for the visits at a location).
        2. `visits.camp`: An integer vector indicating the number of visit at a specific location that is a campsite (indicated by `location` and `campsite == T`) the data point is assigned to (i.e. counter for the visits at a campsite).
        2. `res.time`: The residence time at a specific location [s], only if `return_summary = T`.
        3. `campsite`: A logical value indicating whether a specific visit of a location is considered as campsite or not (based on `t.min`).
        4. `arrival.time`: A character representing the arrival time for a specific visit of a location. The format is `"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"`, only if `return_summary = T`..
        5. `departure.time`: A character representing the departure time for a specific visit of a location. The format is `"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"`, only if `return_summary = T`.
        4. `arrival.time1`: A numeric value representing the arrival time for a specific visit of a location as row index of `trs`, only if `return_summary = T`.
        5. `departure.time1`: A numeric value representing the departure time for a specific visit of a location as row index of `trs`, only if `return_summary = T`.
        6. `lat`: A numeric value representing the centroids for the latitude of fixes corresponding to a specific visit of a location [°].
        7. `lon`: A numeric value representing the centroids for the longitude of fixes corresponding to a specific visit of a location [°].
        8. `alt`: A numeric value representing the mean elevation value of fixes corresponding to a specific visit of a location [m].
        9. `speed`: A numeric value indicating the mean speed at the time fixes were taken for fixes corresponding to a specific visit of a location [m s<sup>-1</sup>].

## identifyBlocksVariable

Function in order to identify blocks of rows in the `data` slot of a `Track` object based on a grouping variable and a value for this variable. A block is defined as a set of directly subsequent rows with the same value for the specified variable.

    + `value`: A value of the `track@data$variable` for which to identify blocks of subsequent rows.
    
* Value: 
    + A `matrix` with two columns and rows for each identified block. The first column indicates the row of `track@data` where the block begins and the second column indicates the row of `track@data` where the block ends or `NULL` if `value` does not exist for `variable`.

## identifyTimeIntervals

Function in order to assign each data value (row) in the `data` slot of a
`Track` obkect to a user specified time interval.

* Arguments:
    + `track`: A `Track`object with a `POSIXct` column `time` in `track@data`.
    + `timeinterval`: One of `"year"`, `"month"`, `"tendayinterval"`, `"day"` or `"all"`. If `timeinterval = "year"`, data values will be classified on a yearly resolution. If `timeinterval = "month"`, data values will be classified on a monthly resolution. If `timeinterval = tendayinterval`, data values will be classified on a ten-day interval resolution. Each month has three ten-day intervals with the last having varying lengths of 11 to 8 days (depending on the month and the occurance of leap years).

## removeDataTrack

Function in order to determine if data values of a `Track` object for specific time intervals should be classified as usable (i.e. they should not be removed in following analyses) or not, based on a user specified threshold value of the proportion of missing values within a month. Uses the function `identifyTimeIntervals` in order to classify data values according to time intervals.

* Arguments:
    + `track`: A `Track`object with a boolean column `gap` in `track@data`. Data values have to be regularly spaced (along time).
    + `timeinterval`: One of `"year"`, `"month"`, `"tendayinterval"`, `"day"` or `"NULL"`. If `timeinterval = "year`, computations will be conducted on a yearly basis, i.e. the proportion of gaps will be evaluated for each year `track` covers. If `timeinterval = "month"`, computations will be conducted on a monhly basis, i.e. the proportion of gaps will be evaluated for each month `track` covers. If `timeinterval = "tendayinterval"`, computations will be conducted on the basis of ten-day intervals, i.e. the proportion of gaps will be evaluated for each ten-day interval `track` covers. Each month has three ten-day intervals with the last having varying lengths of 11 to 8 days (depending on the month and the occurance of leap years). If `timeinterval = "day"`, computations will be conducted on a daily basis, i.e. the proportion of gaps will be evaluated for each day `track` covers. All time intervals that are not completely covered by `track` (i.e. potentially at the start and end of `track`) are handled as if they would represent the whole specified time interval. If `timeintervall = "all"`, computations will be conducted for the whole study period, i.e. the proportion of gaps will be evaluated for the total range the `Track` object covers.  Default is `timeinterval = "month"`. 
    + `threshold`: A numerical value representing the maximum proportion of data values within `timeinterval` that is allowed to represent gaps (`track@data$gap == T`) in order to *not* discard all data values for the corresponding month [%]. Default is `threshold = 40`.
   
* Value: 
    + A `Track` object identical with `track`, except for a new column `track@data$remove` indicating if a data value should be included in following analyses (`track@data$remove == F`) or not (`track@data$remove == T`), based on the specifications of the user, a new column `track@data$id_timeinterval` representing the id of the respective time interval specified by `timeinterval` and a new column `track@data$proportion_gaps` representing the temporal proportion of missing values within a time interval specified by `track@data$id_timeinterval`.

All time intervals that are not completely covered by `track` (i.e. potentially at the start and end of `track`) are handled as if they would represent the whole specified time interval. If `timeintervall = "all"`, computations will be conducted for the whole study period, i.e. the proportion of gaps will be evaluated for the total range the `Track` object covers.  Default is `timeinterval = "month"`. 
    + `threshold`: A numerical value representing the maximum proportion of data values within `timeinterval` that is allowed to represent gaps (`track@data$gap == T`) in order to *not* discard all data values for the corresponding month [%]. Default is `threshold = 40`.
    + `cores`: The number of cores to use in parallel computation. Default is `cores = 1`.
    + `clcall`: Additional arguments exported to `clusterCall` (e.g. in order to supply alternative paths to look packages for). Default is `clcall = NULL`. 
   
* Value: 
    + A `Tracks` object with `Track` objects identical with the input `Track` objects, except for a new column `track@data$remove` indicating if a data value should be included in following analyses (`track@data$remove == F`) or not (`track@data$remove == T`), based on the specifications of the user, a new column `track@data$id_timeinterval` representing the id of the respective time interval specified by `timeinterval` and a new column `track@data$proportion_gaps` representing the temporal proportion of missing values within a time interval specified by `track@data$id_timeinterval`.
